// This is the main application component for a portfolio website.
// It serves as a layout for the application, allowing nested routes to render
// their content within the main section. The `Outlet` component from
// `react-router-dom` is used to render the child routes defined in the router
// configuration. This allows for a clean separation of concerns, where each
// page (like About, Portfolio, Contact) can be developed independently and
// still be part of the overall application structure. The main section can
// also be styled using CSS to create a cohesive look and feel across the
// portfolio site. This component can be imported and used in the main entry
// point of the application (e.g., `main.jsx`) to set up the routing and
// render the appropriate page based on the current URL. By using `Outlet`, the
// application can dynamically switch between different pages without needing
// to reload the entire application, providing a smooth user experience. This
// approach is particularly useful for single-page applications (SPAs) where
// the goal is to provide a fast and responsive interface for users to navigate
// through different sections of the portfolio without unnecessary page reloads.
// The `App` component can also include additional features such as a navigation
// bar, footer, or global styles that apply to all pages. This helps maintain
// consistency across the portfolio and enhances the overall user experience.
